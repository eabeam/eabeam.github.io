I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Vermont. I am also an affiliate of the Gund Institute, a research fellow at the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), and an invited researcher at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).Â 

As a development economist, my work focuses on employment, education, and social inclusion. My research explores practical solutions to challenges facing disadvantaged communities worldwide. I specialize in conducting randomized impact evaluations in partnership with governments and NGOs. These evaluations aim to identify, improve, and scale effective interventions to enhance learning outcomes, facilitate employment, and help households build better futures.

My ongoing projects investigate social protection and graduation programs for ultra-poor households, childcare access and quality, labor market discrimination, and remote education technologies. My research spans multiple countries, including the Philippines, Bangladesh, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Brazil, and the United States.

Before joining the University of Vermont, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics and Public Policy from the University of Michigan in 2013, where I also completed a B.S. in Economics, Mathematics, and Spanish.
