  abstract={I estimate the causal impact of attending a job fair onemployment outcomes and labor market perceptions, using
a randomized encouragement design to induce individuals in the rural Philippines to attend a nearby job fair for
domestic and overseaswork. Attending a job fair matters: though it does not facilitate direct matcheswith a jobfair
employer, attendance leads to a large increase in reported formal sector employment and in the likelihood of
looking for any work outside the region in the months following the job fair. Several overseas recruitment agencies
participated in the job fair, and attendance affects individuals' overseas labor market perceptions but does
not encourage them to take steps to migrate. These results suggest that job fairs can be important tools for encouraging
individuals to move to the formal sector and for conveying information about labor market prospects.},

  title={Search costs and the determinants of job search},
  author={Beam, Emily A},
  journal={Labour Economics},
  volume={69},
  pages={101968},
  year={2021},
  abstract={This paper examines how individuals select into job search in terms of their individual qualifications and percep- tions and measures how recruiting additional applicants with a modest job-search subsidy affects selection. I use experimental evidence to examine individualsâ€™ decisions to attend and participate in a job fair. Thirteen percent of invited but unsubsidized respondents attend the job fair, and they are positively selected from the overall dis- tribution of respondents. While the subsidy attracts those who are less qualified and less confident in their ability to find work abroad, the least qualified do not search intensively. Although the subsidy does not lead to any additional offers, it induces individuals with a high degree of uncertainty about their likelihood of job-finding to apply with recruitment agencies. These results demonstrate the importance of imperfect information about the returns to search and highlight how reducing search costs can increase search effort among those most uncertain about their prospects.}
