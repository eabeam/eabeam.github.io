  year={2016},
  abstract={I estimate the causal impact of attending a job fair onemployment outcomes and labor market perceptions, using
a randomized encouragement design to induce individuals in the rural Philippines to attend a nearby job fair for
domestic and overseaswork. Attending a job fair matters: though it does not facilitate direct matcheswith a jobfair
employer, attendance leads to a large increase in reported formal sector employment and in the likelihood of
looking for any work outside the region in the months following the job fair. Several overseas recruitment agencies
participated in the job fair, and attendance affects individuals' overseas labor market perceptions but does
not encourage them to take steps to migrate. These results suggest that job fairs can be important tools for encouraging
individuals to move to the formal sector and for conveying information about labor market prospects.},

  abstract={Researchers make hundreds of decisions about data collection, preparation,
and analysis in their research. We use a many-analysts approach to measure
the extent and impact of these decisions. Two published causal empirical
results are replicated by seven replicators each. We find large differences in
data preparation and analysis decisions, many of which would not likely be
reported in a publication. No two replicators reported the same sample size.
Statistical significance varied across replications, and for one of the studies the
effect's sign varied as well. The standard deviation of estimates across replications
was 3–4 times the mean reported standard error.}

  title={Does younger age at marriage affect divorce? Evidence from Johnson's Executive Order 11241},
  author={Bailey, Martha J and Beam, Emily A and Wentz, Anna},
  journal={Economic Inquiry},
  year={2021},
  publisher={Wiley Online Library},
  pdf={Bailey Beam Wentz - EI - 2021 - Midnight Marriages.pdf},
  abstract={Before President Johnson's Executive Order 11241 in August 1965, married
men received lower draft priority for military service. As the Vietnam War
escalated in the summer of 1965, anecdotal evidence suggests draft-eligible
men sought marriage to lower their likelihood of serving. This paper quantifies
the effects of these Vietnam-era policies on marriage and finds that they significantly
reduced the age at first marriage and altered the choice of spouse. However,
younger marriages induced by the war were less likely to result in divorce
15 years later. Evidence also suggests that these younger marriages had little
effect on long-term outcomes.}

  title={Search costs and the determinants of job search},
  author={Beam, Emily A},
  journal={Labour Economics},
  volume={69},
  pages={101968},
  year={2021},
  abstract={This paper examines how individuals select into job search in terms of their individual qualifications and percep- tions and measures how recruiting additional applicants with a modest job-search subsidy affects selection. I use experimental evidence to examine individuals’ decisions to attend and participate in a job fair. Thirteen percent of invited but unsubsidized respondents attend the job fair, and they are positively selected from the overall dis- tribution of respondents. While the subsidy attracts those who are less qualified and less confident in their ability to find work abroad, the least qualified do not search intensively. Although the subsidy does not lead to any additional offers, it induces individuals with a high degree of uncertainty about their likelihood of job-finding to apply with recruitment agencies. These results demonstrate the importance of imperfect information about the returns to search and highlight how reducing search costs can increase search effort among those most uncertain about their prospects.},

  pdf={Beam - JEE - 2021 - Leveraging Outside Readings.pdf},
  abstract={The author of this article describes an intermediate economics course structured
around outside readings, which include academic journal papers, policy briefs,
and news articles. Students complete low-stakes, high-frequency writing assignments
that promote accountability and encourage critical thinking about the
readings. This pairing of outside readings and writing assignments leads to
increased student engagement, high rates of self-reported reading, and high
satisfaction with the course without imposing an unreasonable grading workload
on the instructor. This model may be especially useful to instructors in intermediate
and advanced courses who seek to increase students’ exposure to recent
developments in their field and strengthen their ability to engage critically with
economic theory and ideas.}

  abstract={We use a randomized field experiment to test the causal impact of short-term work experience on employment and school enrollment among disadvantaged, in-school youth in the Philippines. This experience leads to a 4.4 percentage point (79\%) increase in employment eight to twelve months later. Although we find no aggregate increase in enrollment, we also do not
find that the employment gains push youth out of school. Our results are most consistent with work experience serving as a signal of unobservable applicant quality, and these findings highlight the role of temporary work as a stepping stone to employment for low-income youth.}

  abstract={We implement a field experiment designed to increase participants’ willingness to visit a health clinic. We find
that framing a $50 incentive as a loss rather than a gain increases take-up, but we do not find support for the
notion that loss aversion is responsible for the effectiveness of loss framing. Instead, it appears that loss framing
promotes take-up by raising the perceived probability that the incentive will be provided as promised. The results
suggest trust is an alternative pathway through which loss framing may affect behavior, and trust may be an
important way to promote desirable health behaviors.},

  pages={103069},
  year={2023},
  publisher={Elsevier},
  abstract={Online technologies enable lower-cost, rapid data collection, but concerns about access and data quality impede their use in global research. I conduct a randomized experiment in the Philippines to test the effectiveness of web-form and chatbot surveys of K--12 teachers recruited through social media and compare their effectiveness with phone surveys of teachers recruited from a pre-existing frame. Chatbot surveys yield
higher response rates and higher-quality data than web-form surveys in terms of missed question and item di erentiation. The results suggest that chatbot responses match CATI responses on multiple dimensions of quality. Relative to CATI, online methods
also yield higher rates or information disclosure on potentially sensitive topics, revealing substantially higher levels of distress among teachers. I show that social-media-based recruitment can be an attractive alternative for targeted sampling and that online
surveys can be implemented effectively at a fraction of the cost of phone surveys.},
